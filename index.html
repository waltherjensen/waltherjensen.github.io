    <p>I am a PhD Fellow in Human Computer Interaction at Aalborg University, Denmark and am currently on a 4 month study abroad in the HCI Engineering Group at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence
      Laboratory (MIT CSAIL). My research aims to ease the know-how required to manually fabricate electrochromic displays, in addition to also investigating in which application cases this display type can be used.</p>
    <p>I have a background in Media Technology and have worked with vibrotactile feedback for navigational cues, interactive urban installations and drone - human interactions, specifically investigating when and how drones can communicate to humans.</p>

<!-- I am EPSRC postdoctoral research fellow in Human Computer Interaction at the University of Bristol, UK and am currently on a secondment in the HCI Engineering Group at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (MIT CSAIL). My research aims to create synergy between the fields of Material Science and Computer Science, with a particular focus on the fabrication of smart, re-programmable and interactive materials.

I have a background in Aerospace Engineering/Material Science and undertook my PhD within the Advanced Composites Collaboration for Innovation and Science (ACCIS) at Bristol developing 3D printed vascular networks for self-healing polymeric materials.

I'm an avid CrossFitter, certified Rescue Scuba Diver (Divemaster in training) and enjoy playing the guitar and piano in my spare time. I also like the odd bit of travelling and photo-taking. -->
